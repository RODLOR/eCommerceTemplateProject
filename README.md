      <h1>E-commerce Template</h1>
      <p>
        This project is a personal project aimed at creating an e-commerce
        template that will serve as a starting point for people who want to
        create an online store. The template will consist of both a client-side
        and server-side implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The client-side implementation will be built using Vite, Reactjs,
        react_router_dom, tailwind, postcss, autoprefixer, and axios. The
        client-side will be designed to work as a single-page web application,
        providing a seamless and smooth shopping experience for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server-side implementation will be built using Python, Flask,
        PyMySQL, and MySQL. The server-side will be designed as a RESTful API
        that will provide data to the client-side. The API will handle various
        tasks such as user authentication, product management, order management,
        and payment processing.
      </p>

        This project is a personal project and I am not currently accepting
        contributions. However, anyone is free to use the idea for their own
        projects or to fork the project and create their own version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this project is still in very early development, and
        there is still a lot of work to be done. Currently, the focus is on
        setting up the basic project structure and implementing the necessary
        functionality to create and manage products.
